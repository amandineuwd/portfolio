            <h1>Sonepar — Product Designer</h1>
            <h3>May–August 2025 | Paris, France</h3>

            <p>
              During my internship at Sonepar, I worked as a Product Designer on a
              B2B mobile application dedicated to professional clients. I was involved
              from the very early stages of the project, shaping user flows, designing
              wireframes, and building interactive prototypes to make the experience as
              intuitive and efficient as possible.
              <br /><br />
              A key part of my mission was to analyze the customer journey, identify
              pain points, and propose improvements that could boost both satisfaction
              and conversion. I also conducted user tests, iterated on feedback, and
              collaborated closely with a multidisciplinary and multicultural team
              including UX/UI designers, product owners, product managers, developers,
              and business teams.
              <br /><br />
              This experience really strengthened my confidence in user-centered design
              and taught me how to approach complex problems with structure, empathy,
              and creativity.

            <p>
              Working at Colores during the summer seasons gave me the chance to interact
              with a diverse, international clientele. I was responsible for welcoming
              customers, advising them, and creating an engaging and friendly shopping
              experience. I also helped maintain the store’s visual merchandising,
              organized stock, and handled payments.
              <br /><br />
              Beyond the daily responsibilities, this job taught me how to adapt quickly,
              communicate with people from all backgrounds, and work efficiently in a
              fast-paced, tourism-centered environment. It strengthened my customer-facing
              skills and made me more confident in managing both service and operational
              tasks.

            <p>
              At Société Générale, I worked as a front desk assistant, where my main role
              was to welcome clients, understand their needs, and guide them toward the
              right services or advisors. I also handled various administrative tasks such

              compliance with internal procedures and banking regulations.
              <br /><br />
              This experience taught me precision, autonomy, and professionalism. It helped
              me develop strong organizational skills and the ability to stay calm and
              efficient in a highly regulated environment.
